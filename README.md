Hey everyone! Here I am writing the code for creating a new linked list from a/an vector/ array and performing the CRUD operations like -
Insertion and deletion of 3 types each as - 1. at begining, 2.at specified position, 3. at last.
All the CRUD operations are begin with HEAD pointer* like the master key, so play with the head of the linked list to perform all the operations.
